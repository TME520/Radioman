Scripts and stuff used for my wardriving setup.

## Files

- `wardriving_status.sh`: It's the main script, the one you have to start in order to use this tool,
- `wardriving_status-RPI.sh`: A deprecated version of the tool that was aimed specifically at Raspberry Pi computers,
- `wardriving_status-dummy-demo.sh`: A demonstration version of the tool that uses fake data. Not meant to be used at all.
